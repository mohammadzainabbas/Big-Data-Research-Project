### 1. Object detection

We are using [`Yolov7`](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) for object detection. The original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02696).

There are [several models](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7#performance) which are availble for free; but for purpose, we are using the baseline [`YOLOv7`](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/download/v0.1/yolov7.pt) model.

#### 1.1. Yolov7

`YOLOv7` surpasses all known object detectors in both speed and accuracy in the range from `5` FPS to `160` FPS and has the highest accuracy `56.8%` AP among all known real-time object detectors with `30` FPS or higher on GPU V100.

Checkout details about `Yolov7`'s architecture and some benchmarks [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02696.pdf).
