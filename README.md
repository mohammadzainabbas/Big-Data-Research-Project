### 1. Introduction

__`Data drives the world.`__ Nowadays, most of the data (_structured_ or _unstructured_) can be analysed as a graph. Today, many practical computing problems concern large graphs. Standard examples include the Web graph and various social networks. The scale of these graphs (_in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges_) poses challenges to their efficient processing.
